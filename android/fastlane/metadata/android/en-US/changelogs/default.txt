Version 1.3

Version 1.3 changes how gifted games and hardware work.
Instead of only being able to indicate that a game has been gifted, you can now also select that a game has been borrowed or purchased.
Games on your wish list will receive the status "observing".

From now on, games on your wish list will no longer be included in the analytics of your library.

Have fun with Pile of Shame!
